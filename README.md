# Modelling COVID-19 Deaths in the US (Final Project for DATA 100, an upper-division data science course taught at UC Berkeley)

In this project, we explore the COVID-19 datasets to better understand the factors behind COVID-19 mortality and to develop an algorithm that can predict the number of county deaths from the disease according to a defined set of features. We find that population density is highly correlated with the number of deaths in a certain county, which supports national guidelines of social distancing. Our multi-linear regression model further predicts county deaths with a decent level of accuracy, generalizing well to unseen data and scalable for modeling applications.
